SAFETY NOTICE:

This software is designed for research and development of Artificial General 
Intelligence (AGI) systems. Users are responsible for:

1. Implementing appropriate safety measures and monitoring systems
2. Following AI safety best practices and ethical guidelines  
3. Ensuring proper oversight and human control over all operations
4. Conducting thorough safety evaluations before deployment
5. Reporting any safety concerns or unexpected behaviors immediately

The developers and contributors disclaim any liability for misuse of this 
software or any consequences arising from inadequate safety measures. 

This system includes safety mechanisms such as the Themis oversight agent, 
but users must ensure these are properly configured and monitored. Always 
prioritize safety over functionality in AGI research and development.

For safety-related questions or concerns, please consult with AGI safety 
experts and follow established safety protocols in your organization.
